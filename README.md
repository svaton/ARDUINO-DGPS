# ARDUINO-DGPS
This is a proposal of low cost solution of differential GPS based on low cost reciever modules uBlox NEO6M. The work has been done as part of Master Thesis composed at Linkoping University and CVUT in Prague. 

# Abstract

The Arduino DGPS solution proposes the algorithms for position accuracy improvements in two ways. The first mode uses a range residual computed by the receiver to estimate pseudorange corrections (PRCs) and corresponding position correction. The second mode works as a SBAS correction repeater, which uses the SBAS correction to acquire the position correction.
